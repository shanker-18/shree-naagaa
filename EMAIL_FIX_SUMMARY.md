# 🔧 Email Sending Issue - FIXED!

## ❌ **Problem Identified:**
Emails were being sent incorrectly when users clicked "Continue to Order Summary" button, instead of only when they clicked "Place Order".

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**
- The `createOrder()` function in `orderService.ts` was sending emails immediately when called
- This function is called from `OrderDetails.tsx` when user clicks "Continue to Order Summary"  
- Users were receiving emails before actually placing their orders

## ✅ **Solution Implemented:**

### 1. **Removed Email Sending from createOrder()**
- **File:** `src/services/orderService.ts`
- **Change:** Removed email sending logic from lines 143-165
- **Result:** Emails no longer sent during navigation to order summary

### 2. **Email Now Sent Only After Order Placement**
- **File:** `src/components/OrderSummary.tsx`
- **Function:** `handlePlaceOrder()` (lines 91-105)
- **Result:** Emails sent only when user clicks "Place Order" button

### 3. **Fixed Backend Server Issues**
- **File:** `server.js`
- **Issue:** MongoDB connection string was pointing to localhost
- **Fix:** Updated to use production MongoDB Atlas URI
- **Result:** Backend server now runs successfully with `node server.js`

## 🎯 **Current Email Flow:**

### ✅ **Correct Flow:**
1. User fills order details → **No email sent**
2. User clicks "Continue to Order Summary" → **No email sent** 
3. User reviews order summary → **No email sent**
4. User clicks "Place Order" → **✅ Email sent to warehouse**

### 📧 **Email Details:**
- **Recipient:** Warehouse team (shreeraga@gmail.com)
- **Trigger:** Only when "Place Order" is clicked
- **Content:** Order ID, customer details, items, total amount
- **Service:** EmailJS (service_lfndsjx, template_xdvaj0r)
